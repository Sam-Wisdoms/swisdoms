Personal Portfolio

## About the Project
The project is my personal portfolio developed using React.js

## Tools Used
The tools that were used in creating this project are;
1. React.js
2. Node.js
3. NPM
4. Fontawesome library
5. Command Line Interface
6. React Router

## Challenges & Successes
I have had challenges getting fontawesome icons for LinkedIn, X and gitHub. Another challenge I have had has to do with deployment on gitHub pages and understanding how to use som React libraries.
I must however, say that, I have learned from the challenges and now have a better understanding of some of the issues.
